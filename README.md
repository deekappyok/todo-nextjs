## Cloudflare Integration

Cloudflare proxies your requests, and we use the `CF-Connecting-IP` header to capture the real IP address of users, ensuring privacy and security.

---

## Deployment

1. Deploy the app to **Vercel** or any cloud platform that supports Next.js.
2. Set the `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, and any other necessary environment variables.
